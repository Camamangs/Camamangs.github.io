    Wise men say <br>
Only fools rush in<br>
And I can't help falling in love with you<br>
I wonder if I'm ever on her mind like she's on mine<br>
Probably not<br>
Swear I've never seen a girl so fine<br>
She probably got tons of guys tryna hit her line<br>
And take her time, I guess I better step in line<br>
She got me shook<br>
Fell in love on the first look, typical<br>
Always catching feelings when the feelings not reciprocal<br>
Love is just so difficult<br>
Builds you up then tears you down<br>
Every time she comes around<br>
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma<br>
Fool for her<br>
Acting cool for her<br>
She's too bad for me<br>
But I'm too good for her<br>
She makes me so nervous, probably on purpose<br>
She's just so perfect<br>
I just can't help it<br>
'Cause wise men say only fools rush in<br>
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men<br>
Wise men say only fools rush in<br>
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men, like<br>
Wise men say<br>
Only fools rush in<br>
And I can't help falling in love with you<br>
Yeah, I tend to fall in love with every pretty girl I see practically<br>
But how come they never fall in love with me, I mean gee pardon me<br>
But I'm better than those assholes you talk to<br>
Who claim that they got you, but clearly that's not true<br>
I feel the vibe between us<br>
Can you feel it too?<br>
Or maybe I'm just trippin'<br>
I'm just really feeling you<br>
You on a power trip, that pretty girl power shit<br>
Got every guy falling<br>
You'd have Superman powerless<br>
It ain't fair, I swear it ain't fair<br>
The way she look I can't help but just stare<br>
She makes me so nervous, probably on purpose<br>
She's just so perfect<br>
I just can't help it<br>
'Cause wise men say only fools rush in<br>
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men<br>
Wise men say only fools rush in<br>
But pretty girls make fools outta wise men, like<br>
Wise men say (you know what they say)<br>
Only fools rush in<br>
And I can't help falling in love with you<br>
