    <h1>Glimpse of Us</h1>
    <hr>
    She'd take the world off my shoulders <br>
If it was ever hard to move<br>
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow<br>
When I was living in the blue<br>
Why then, if she is so perfect<br>
Do I still wish that it was you?<br>
Perfect don't mean that it's working<br>
So what can I do? (Ooh)<br>
When you're out of sight<br>
In my mind<br>
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
And I try to fall for her touch<br>
But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
Said I'm fine and said I moved on<br>
I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
Hoping I'll find<br>
A glimpse of us<br>
Tell me he savors your glory<br>
Does he laugh the way I did?<br>
Is this a part of your story?<br>
One that I had never lived<br>
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely<br>
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse<br>
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly<br>
And find me again<br>
When you're out of sight<br>
In my mind<br>
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
And I try to fall for her touch<br>
But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
Said I'm fine and said I moved on<br>
I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
Hoping I'll find<br>
A glimpse of us<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br>
And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
And I try to fall for her touch<br>
But I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
Said I'm fine and said I moved on<br>
I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
Hoping I'll find<br>
A glimpse of us<br>
