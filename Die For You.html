    <hr>
    Swear I couldn't sleep a wink last night <br>
No point in turnin' off the lights<br>
Not the same without your head on my shoulders<br>
Growin' pains, but I don't wanna get older<br>
Almost like we left it all on read<br>
Couple feelings never laid to rest<br>
Didn't know that the party was over<br>
And it's true that I need you, get closer<br>
Burning photos<br>
Had to learn to let go<br>
I used to be<br>
Somebody in another skin <i>(another skin)</i><br>
I heard that you're happy without me<br>
And I hope it's true<br>
<i>{I hope, I hope it's true)</i><br>
It kills me a little, that's okay<br>
'Cause I'd <strong>die for you</strong><br>
You know I'd still <strong>die for you</strong><br>
I hope you're getting everything you needed (needed)<br>
Found the puzzle piece and feel completed (completed)<br>
Just wanted you to know every reason<br>
Hope you really know that I mean that<br>
I couldn't see<br>
The forest from the trees<br>
Only time we speak<br>
Is in my dreams<br>
Burning photos<br>
Had to learn to let go<br>
I used to be<br>
Somebody in another skin (another skin)<br>
I heard that you're happy without me<br>
And I hope it's true<br>
<i>{I hope, I hope it's true)</i><br>
It kills me a little, that's okay<br>
'Cause I'd <strong>die for you</strong><br>
You know I'd still <strong>die for you</strong><br></center>
