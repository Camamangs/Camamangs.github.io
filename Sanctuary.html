        <hr>
        Go ahead and park after dark <br>
Fallen star, I'm your one call away<br>
Motel halls, neon walls<br>
When night falls, I am your escape<br>
When you lay alone, I ache<br>
Something I wanted to feel<br>
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love<br>
Babe, you don't have to wait on me<br>
'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above<br>
But an angel ain't what I need<br>
Not anyone, you're the one<br>
More than fun, you're the sanctuary<br>
'Cause what you want is what I want<br>
Sincerity<br>
Souls that dream alone lie awake<br>
I'll give you something so real<br>
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love<br>
Babe, you don't have to wait on me<br>
'Cause I've been aiming for Heaven above<br>
But an angel ain't what I need<br>
Pull me, oh, so close<br>
'Cause you never know<br>
Just how long our lives will be<br>
If you've been waiting for fallin' in love<br>
Babe, you don't have to wait on me<br>
'Cause I've been aiming for Heaven above<br>
But an angel ain't what I need<br>
